## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was mainly a consolidation exercise of the html5 and CSS3 techniques which I have been learning recently

Initially the component would not center on the screen utilising

  ```css
  body{display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;}
  ```
  
I had to add the collowing to the body:

  ```css
  height:100vh;
  ```

I assume this is due to me applying the display:flex to the body. Will clarify whether this is the case in the next project I undertake.

### Continued development

I'd like to further this project in the future, utilising JSON and Javascript to dynamically load the data displaying several QR Codes on the page at once.
